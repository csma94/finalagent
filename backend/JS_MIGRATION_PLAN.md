# Backend JavaScript Migration Plan

This document tracks the progress of standardizing all backend services to JavaScript for a clean, buildable, and maintainable backend.

## Objective
- Remove all TypeScript service files from backend
- Ensure all backend services are implemented in JavaScript
- Update all imports to use `.js` files
- Remove TypeScript build steps for backend services
- Achieve a green build and reliable runtime
